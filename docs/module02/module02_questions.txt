Module 2: Study Guide Questions 

1. Given the reaction A+B→C+D and using ∆Go=-RTlnKeq: (Useful calculations: ln1=0, 
ln<1=negative, ln>1=positive.) 
(A) if, at equilibrium, the products concentrations equaled 2M and the reactants 
concentrations equaled 1M, would ∆Go be positive or negative and would this reaction be 
favorable or unfavorable as written?  
(B) if, at equilibrium, the products concentrations equaled 1M and the reactants 
concentrations equaled 2M, would ∆Go be positive or negative and would this reaction be 
favorable or unfavorable as written?

3.  Describe an experiment to determine how and if cells obey the second law of 
thermodynamics.  Include  
(A) what the second law of thermodynamics states,  
(B) a description of the experiment, and  
(C) the results and how they indicate whether cells obey this law. 

4.  Consider the reaction equation for hydrolysis of ATP:   ATP + H20        ADP + Pi + H+. 
What determines whether this reaction is favorable in a cell?  Your description should be in 
terms of  
(A) Greaction = G˚ + RTlnK   
(B) intrinsic properties, and  
(C) system properties. 

5.  ∆Go of a chemical reaction is dependent on the enthalpy and entropy of the products and 
the reactants. 
(A)  Describe the thermodynamic laws that pertain to enthalpy and entropy. 
(B)  Using the jumping bean analogy, describe how enthalpy and entropy determine if a 
reaction is favorable or unfavorable as written. 
(C)  Using the equation ∆Go = ∆H - T∆S and bar graphs (described in class) to describe their 
role in determining if a reaction is spontaneous as written. 

6.  Given that Greaction = G˚ + RTlnK and using the jumping bean analogy,  
(A)  describe the role of Keq and K in determining if a reaction is spontaneous as written. 
(B)  What is the relative (<. >, = 1) ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium and under 
cellular conditions for ATP hydrolysis? 
(C)  Using the table in the slides for lecture 5, what would be the G˚ and Greaction for 
reactions with [B]/[A] ratios at equilibrium and starting conditions, respectively, of 103, 101, 1, 10-
1 and 10-3?

7.  Many reactions that a cell must have occur to live and grow are thermodynamically 
unfavorable. 
(A)  What is meant by thermodynamically unfavorable? 
(B)  How do cells “drive” these reactions to occur? 
(C)  How is glutamine synthesis from glutamate and NH4
thermodynamically and mechanistically? 

+ (G˚ = 4 kcal/mole) driven in cells 

8.  Instant cold packs get cold when the contents, usually solid urea and liquid water, are 
mixed, producing an aqueous solution of urea.  Although this process is clearly spontaneous, 
the products are colder than the reactants.  Explain how this is possible in terms of the 
difference between G and H. 

9.  Rank the following bonds or interactions in order of strength: hydrogen bond, covalent 
bond, ionic bond, and van der Waals interaction.  What typical strengths (G˚) of these 
bonds/interactions in kcal/mole?  How does the environment (e.g. water vs. vacuum) affect 
each type of bond/interaction? 

10.  True or false: All single, non-covalent bonds or interactions are too weak to withstand the 
thermal motions (~1 kcal/mole) that tend to pull interacting molecules apart. 

11.  Which type of non-covalent interaction is favored by (in fact, dependent on) an aqueous 
environment and strengthened by the presence of added ions? 

12.  Briefly describe that key attributes of the four types of non-covalent 
bonds/interactions/forces.

16.  Define pKa for a weak acid in the following two ways:  (1) in relation to its acid dissociation 
constant, Ka, and (2) by reference to a titration curve for the weak acid.  

17.  Describe the key aspects of the shared common structure between the 20 common 
amino acids. 

18.  What are the three main classifications of amino acids as described in class?  Describe 
any sub-classifications of these three main classifications.  What portion of each amino acid 
determines how it is classified?  Provide an example for each class of amino acid.
