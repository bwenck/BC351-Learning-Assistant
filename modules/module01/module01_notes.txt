Cancer overview:
- Cancer develops when normal regulation of cell growth and division breaks down.
- Mutations provide abnormal growth advantages, leading to clonal expansion and tumor formation.
- Cancer is widespread; about 40% of people will develop it and ~20% will die from it.

Cancer classification:
- Cancers are often classified by behavior (benign, malignant, metastatic) and by tissue or cell type of origin.
- Major categories include epithelial cancers (carcinomas) and non-epithelial cancers (sarcomas, melanomas, etc.).
- Histological appearance under the microscope remains an important classification tool.

Cancer progression and age:
- Cancer typically arises through multiple accumulating changes over time.
- Progression can be seen in changing cellular and tissue morphology, such as in cervical cancer.
- Cancer incidence increases with age, supporting the idea of multiple mutation events being required.

Environmental and lifestyle factors:
- Lifestyle, geography, and environment strongly influence cancer types and incidence.
- When people migrate, their cancer patterns shift to match those of their new location.
- External factors include chemicals (e.g., tobacco smoke), physical factors (UV, radiation), and lifestyle factors (diet, smoking, reproductive choices).
- Around 80-90% of cancers may be avoidable, though prevention strategies remain complex.

Cancer treatment progress:
- Death rates for many cancers have not dramatically declined; improvements often rely on early detection.
- Pre-1975 treatments targeted rapid cell division; targeted therapies now exist.
- Targeted therapies exploit cancer-specific vulnerabilities from genetic alterations.
- Drug resistance is common; modern strategies may combine multiple targeted drugs.

Drug design and screening:
- Structure-activity relationship studies modify chemical structures to study effects on biological activity.
- Drug discovery also uses computational modeling of proteins and “combinatorial chemistry” to screen large molecule libraries.

Properties of effective anticancer drugs:
- Anti-cancer drugs should be small, easy to synthesize, and able to enter cells effectively.
- Good targets are “druggable” — proteins with defined active sites (e.g., kinases such as Abl).
- Drugs often target enzymes or signaling pathways essential for cancer cell survival.

Drug testing pipeline:
- Steps include enzyme inhibition assays, cell-based screens, pharmacodynamic studies, toxicity testing, and phased clinical trials.
- Early phases evaluate safety; later phases compare against current standard treatments.

Challenges and future directions:
- Some cancers respond dramatically to targeted drugs but often develop resistance.
- Likely future involves combination therapies and precision medicine guided by genomic analysis.
- Cancer may become more controllable than curable, similar to HIV management.

Biochemistry foundations:
- Four major macromolecule classes: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids.
- Elements most common in cells: C, H, O, N, P, S.
- Chemical properties (valence, electronegativity) influence bonding and molecule behavior.

Water and carbon chemistry:
- Water is polar, forms hydrogen bonds, and is amphoteric (can act as acid or base).
- Water’s hydrogen bonding contributes to high specific heat, surface tension, and solvent abilities.
- Carbon forms diverse stable structures: single, double, triple bonds; rings; polymers; resonance structures.
- Electronegativity order: O > N > C > H; determines polarity of bonds and functional behavior.

Cellular evolution:
- Major biochemical pathways and macromolecule types are conserved through evolution.
- Many biological systems persist due to functional success and evolutionary history rather than optimization.

Functional group concept reminder:
- Organic acids and bases are determined by structure and electronegativity of their functional groups.
- One provided diagram (Q18 option C) does not represent a functional acid/base group.
