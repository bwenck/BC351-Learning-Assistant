Thermodynamics and free energy:
- Whether a reaction is favorable depends on free energy change (ΔG).
- ΔG° relates to equilibrium ratio of products to reactants (Keq): ΔG° = –RT ln Keq.
- ΔG in the cell depends not only on intrinsic free energy (ΔG°) but also actual concentrations of reactants and products (RT ln [P]/[R]).
- A reaction can be driven forward by having a high reactant concentration or a favorable ΔG°.
- Unfavorable reactions can be coupled to a highly favorable reaction like ATP hydrolysis.

Free energy and concentration:
- If Keq > 1 then ΔG° is negative and the reaction favors products at equilibrium.
- If Keq < 1 then ΔG° is positive and the reaction favors reactants.
- Cellular ΔG depends on ΔG° and actual metabolite ratios; actual conditions may differ from standard state.

Role of free energy diagrams:
- Graphing reactant vs. product free energy reveals whether a reaction is intrinsically favorable.
- Downhill profiles indicate favorable ΔG; uphill reactions require energy input or coupling.

Second law of thermodynamics:
- The universe tends toward increasing disorder (entropy).
- Biological systems create order internally but increase total entropy of the universe (release heat to surroundings).

ATP hydrolysis energetics:
- ATP → ADP + Pi is strongly favorable due to negative ΔG°’ and maintained high ATP:ADP ratio in cells.
- Cells maintain ATP high relative to ADP and Pi to drive biochemical reactions forward.

Thermodynamic laws:
- First law: energy is conserved (relates to enthalpy, H).
- Second law: systems tend toward disorder (relates to entropy, S).

Cellular energetics:
- Cells grow by converting nutrients (less ordered) into complex biomolecules (more ordered) while releasing heat and increasing disorder in the environment.
- Biochemical reactions balance order creation with overall entropy increase.

Equilibrium and ΔG relationships:
- ΔG° = –RT ln Keq.
- ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q, where Q is the product/reactant ratio in the cell.
- If Q < Keq, reaction proceeds forward; if Q > Keq, reaction goes backward.

Coupled reactions:
- Unfavorable reactions can proceed when coupled to favorable ones, such as ATP hydrolysis.
- Example: glutamine synthesis couples ATP hydrolysis to drive formation of glutamine from glutamate and NH4+.

Enthalpy (H) and entropy (S):
- Favorable reactions often have decreased enthalpy and/or increased entropy.
- Dissolving certain solids can be endothermic but still spontaneous if entropy increases enough.

Non-covalent interactions overview:
- Types: ionic, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, hydrophobic interactions.
- Relative strengths: covalent > ionic > hydrogen bonds > van der Waals.
- Water weakens ionic and hydrogen bonds by competing for interactions.
- Hydrophobic interactions arise from water forming structured cages around nonpolar groups; clustering minimizes ordering of water.

Hydrophobic effect:
- Nonpolar molecules aggregate to minimize water ordering and increase entropy.
- Hydrophobic interactions do not exist without water; they depend on aqueous environment.

Molecular interaction summary:
- Ionic bonds: charge-charge interactions; weakened strongly by water.
- Hydrogen bonds: directional, strongest at 180° alignment; partly electrostatic, partly covalent.
- Van der Waals forces: weak, require very close proximity; unaffected by water.
- Hydrophobic interactions: driven by entropy and water structuring.

Example: ethanol vs ethane solubility:
- Ethanol can hydrogen bond with water; ethane cannot.
- Ethanol’s OH group allows solvation; ethane is hydrophobic and forces water ordering.

Acids, bases, and conjugate bases:
- Conjugate bases identified by removal of a proton from acidic groups (e.g., RCOO–, RNH2, H2PO4–, HCO3–).

Phosphoric acid behavior:
- Polyprotic acid with three dissociable protons.
- At pH 4, H2PO4– predominates.
- pKa values: 2.14, 6.86, 12.4.

pKa and titration:
- pKa = –log Ka.
- pKa equals the pH where concentrations of acid and conjugate base are equal.
- Inflection point on titration curve corresponds to pKa.

Amino acid chemical properties:
- Amino acids have α-carbon bonded to amine, carboxyl, hydrogen, and side chain.
- Side chains determine classification: nonpolar, polar, charged, and special cases.
- Solubility and charge depend on pKa values of amino and carboxyl groups and sometimes side chain groups.
- Isoelectric point (pI): pH where net charge = 0.

Examples:
- Glutamate = negatively charged (polar).
- Lysine = positively charged (polar).
- Serine = uncharged polar.
- Leucine = nonpolar.
- Proline = special structure.

Histidine notes:
- Histidine side chain pKa = ~6.0, allowing buffering near physiological pH.
- At pH ~6, roughly half protonated; net charge near zero.
- Histidine often participates in enzyme acid/base chemistry.
